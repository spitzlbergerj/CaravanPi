# CaravanPi
System for measuring and displaying various values in caravans and motor homes, including climate values, filling levels and levelling data. Magic Mirror is used for presentation.

***You'll find a lot of information to my motivation and a lot of technical details in the Wiki. Please read the Wiki before you start with your construction!***

## Software

Different Python scripts are used to read out the different sensors. They read out the values and write them to different files with current time stamps. Thus, on the one hand, the current value display is possible and on the other hand, history data can be graphically displayed in a later expansion step.

For the display of all information the grandiose software [MagicMirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) is used. This software, which runs on modules, can be designed very flexibly and also comes with a number of existing modules that can usefully supplement the display in the caravan and motorhome. For the display of the sensor data own MMM modules ([MMM-Caravan](https://github.com/spitzlbergerj/MMM-Caravan)) were developed.
