# CaravanPi
System for measuring and displaying various values in caravans and motor homes, including climate values, filling levels and levelling data. Magic Mirror is used for presentation.

# .crontabs
In order to automatically determine and store the measurement data, a series of scripts must be started when the Raspberry Pi is started. I use the Crontabs. 

Alternatively the scripts can be started via pm2, which is installed anyway due to the Magic Mirror.

## crontab of user root


## crontab of user pi
