# CaravanPi
System for measuring and displaying various values in caravans and motor homes, including climate values, filling levels and levelling data. Magic Mirror is used for presentation.

# defaults

A whole series of sensors must be adjusted before use. It is therefore almost impossible to mount the 3-axis position sensor absolutely horizontally. The compensation values are stored in files in this directory. In addition, values such as the empty weight of the gas cylinder are stored in this directory.

## Correction values position sensor


## Tara of the gas bottles scales

## Empty weight of the gas cylinder



## Still to do:
- Capturing options for the empty weight of the gas cylinders and the other correction values
