# CaravanPi
System for measuring and displaying various values in caravans and motor homes, including climate values, filling levels and levelling data. Magic Mirror is used for presentation.

## PIR Sensor

These scripts are used to control the PIR sensor. This in turn controls the screen, which only displays values as long as motion is detected.

**In the meantime I tested the modules available at MagicMirror to control the PIR sensor and now use one of these modules instead of the script here.**
